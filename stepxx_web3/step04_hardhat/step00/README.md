# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node - give accounts addresses and private key with ethers
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

--network localhost: (it is used to deploy)
gives all information about the node, contract deployment, address, eth, from, gas used, and block no
